                <p>
                    The number of those that would be considered "language lovers" continues to grow. We've seen 
                    an ever increasing numbers of self-proclaimed YouTube polyglots and maybe some <em>true</em> 
                    polyglots—-maybe even a hyperpolyglot or two. After many eras of language suppression, a new
                    appreciation for language is being born. Multilingualism is becoming greatly respected and sought 
                    out; many fight a hard fight against the seemingly uphill battle that is second language acquisition.
                    Even the most gifted individuals have to work hard to make a path for themselves.

                        <p><em>noun.</em> the love of language and words</p>
                        <p>Etymology: Latin/Greek neologism based on 
                            the Latin word for 'tongue' <em>lingua</em> and the Greek word for 
                            'love' <em>philos</em> from the verb 'to love' <em>philein</em></p>

                    Language and culture are inextricably connected, and when one learns a language to a practical fluency,
                    he or she gains key to one or many cultures. Yes, becoming fluent fluent can prove to be maybe the most
                    challenging task for anyone starting later in life, but with passion, one can prevail. Machine translation
                    may be able to somewhat supersede the need to "learn" a whole language, but with a lil' linguaphilia, one can
                    take a foreign language and breathe life into it.

                    Learning should be free! Many of us spend countless hours and dollars (or euros, reais, yen, 
                    what have you) to gain skills that hopefully have some sort of future return, be it to improve 
                    employment opportunities or to interact more profoundly with natives on vacations. However, 
                    the age of the Internet has morphed the way that we approach learning. The Internet allows
                    the everyday "Joe" the rapid retrieval of information that is accumulating second by second. 
                    While this is a blessing, finding high quality language learning resources can be a difficult task.

                    Linguaphilia is dedicated to do the work for you: to aseemble the best resources and provide links to the 
                    most useful resources that can be found elsewhere on the internet. We want to make language learning easy
                    and believe that with the proper allocation of time and energy, anyone can reach a conversational fluency
                    and intermediate literacy in any language. It's not something that happens overnight, and requires consistent
                    effort over a long period of time.

                    We are also dedicated to the planet and try to maintain a website that uses less energy given its 
                    darker (Matrix-y) theme. At the same time, we also like to make sure that our websites are converted 
                    to a printable format that uses less ink and allow users to have access to all our resources in different 
                    formats.
