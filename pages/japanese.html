                <h1>Japanese</h1>
                <p>Despite what you may have thought, when considering number of native speakers Japanese is one of the top 10 
                    languages spoken in the world. This is mainly due to the 126.5 million people than inhabit its 6,852 islands.
                    Although most of the speakers reside in Japan, there are sizable populations of Japanese speakers in the US (Hawaii)
                    and Brazil (especially in São Paulo). There are also generations of people in parts of China, Taiwan, and Korea who 
                    were at one time forced to learn Japanese in times of war. The mountains and islands of Japan have caused great 
                    linguistic diversity, but most dialects are mutually intelligible. One notable exception is the Kyūshū dialect of 
                    Kagoshima is not easily understand by speakers of the Tokyo standard known as Honshū (the mainland) dialect.

                    The Foreign Service Institute ranks Japanese as potentially the hardest language for speakers of English and in 
                    the same category as Arabic, Mandarin, Cantonese, and Korean. The FSI states that 2,200 hours are required to 
                    reach general reading and speaking proficiency in any of these languages. That's more than three times of the 
                    amount of time an English speaker would need to reach the same level in <a class="pageLinks" href="spanish.html">
                    Spanish</a>. This difficulty may mainly come from the amount of time that is required to learn how to read Japanese 
                    and grammatical differences, like general sentence word order.

                    Due to prevalence of Chinese in Eastern Asia, Japanese has borrowed extensively from Chinese as has Korean, 
                    Vietnamese, and other languages in the region. Since the mid 18th century, Japanese has also been taking many 
                    words from English, e.g. hotel (ホテル, hoteru), coat (コート, kōto), etc. Interestingly enough, these etymological 
                    borrowings can be seen directly in the script. The Japanese language consists of kanji (Classical Chinese characters that 
                    were modified after World War II) and two syllabaries (hiragana and katakana). Katakana is almost exclusively 
                    used for foreign loanwords not borrowed from Chinese. The characters you see at the beginning of this paragraph 
                    are katakana characters, and each represents a different syllable. Although many words written with katakana may
                    be English words, there are notable exceptions like パン (pan) from pão in Portuguese or ズボン (zubon) which comes
                    from French and was borrowed from Italian and before, from Arabic.

                <p>
                    And when you just thought it was getting easy, we forgot to tell you one thing. Most kanji have two readings: 
                    a native Japanese reading and a Chinese reading. Depending on the era in which a word was borrowed, the Chinese 
                    reading can vary for different words. This requires the learner to learn alternate readings and know when one 
                    reading is required over another. Japanese spend their primary and secondary school years learning the standard 
                    kanji necessary to read most texts. In other words, this can take a <em>long</em> time!
