# Language Learning Website

This language learning application was created to fulfill the final project for Oakton's CIS 131 Web Page Development, a class I took in the fall of 2020. A description of the course can be found in [the Computer Information Systems course descriptions list](https://catalog.oakton.edu/course-descriptions/course-descriptions-discipline/cis/). The syllabus and requirements of the final project are provided in the two pdf documents found in the course_info folder.

The website was created with CSS and HTML. Each page is responsive; a table is broken into two for mobile view on the spanish.html page, and a "language wheel" is converted into a column of language blocks for mobile view on the linguaphilia_language_selection.html page. The website has a lot of color and overall is on the darker side. With this in mind, some time was put into making each page of the website easily printable.

A live version of the website can be found at the [correspondent GitHub subdirectory](john-albright.github.io/language-learning-website).
