                <h1>Welcome to Linguaphilia!</h1>
                <p>Linguaphilia is a website where language enthusiasts can come for original content and links to external resources
                    to aid in their second (third, fourth, etc.) acquisition. Learning a language on one's own can be tough, but in order
                    to fully master any language, one will have to put in a lot of his or her own time to master grammatical concepts and
                    put vocabulary words into longterm memory.

                    At this present moment, we have begun developing the curricula for our <a class="pageLinks" href="/pages/spanish.html">Spanish</a> 
                    and <a class="pageLinks" href="/pages/japanese.html">Japanese</a> courses. The courses we're constructing are designed to save you
                    time as we look for the best resources available on the internet and provide access to them from our website. We know that 
                    learning a language is tough. The amount of time you put into your language acquisition usually reaps great benefits. 
                    However, it is important to be efficient in our learning and take steps to facilitate the process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hopefully, after a year or so of study, you will get a good feel for the language and even go on a trip to the country 
                    where that language is spoken. It's important to put what you've learned into practice and to try to understand a culture
                    in which the language lives. I mean, with Spanish, you have most of Latin America, as well as Spain, covered. Learn some 
                    Portuguese if you want to experience Rio de Janeiro or Lisbon more authentically. Before English, French was the lingua 
                    franca and is still spoken all over Africa, Europe, and even Canada. Maybe take a trip to Quebec and hear some authentic 
                    Quebecois. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    If East Asian culture speaks to you, try learning some Japanese, Korean, or Mandarin Chinese. However, we'll warn you now! These 
                    languages are hard. If you've ever wanted to go to India, you could learn some Hindi (or Urdu), but know that India is 
                    also home to many other languages; some regions do not have large Hindi speaking communities. Whatever language you end 
                    up learning, you will have access to the door to another culture. As Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a 
                    language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his own language, that goes to his heart."

                    This website is constantly under construction, and we take the feedback we receive seriously. At the present moment, 
                    the <em>blog</em> and <em>jobs</em> sections of the website are not 
                    available, so those links in the navigation menu will not open. Should you get lost browsing the website, you can 
                    access the home page by clicking on the Linguaphilia banner at the top of the page. If you would like to contribute 
                    to the process and provide us with an opinion, head over to the <a class="pageLinks" href="/pages/linguaphilia_contact.html">
                    contact page</a> to find our email or to fill our a brief survey.
